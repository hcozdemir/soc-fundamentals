# SOC Fundamentals

This repository documents my step-by-step learning journey toward becoming a SOC Analyst.

It contains foundational concepts, notes, and practical insights gained during my cybersecurity training, with a focus on understanding how systems, networks, and logs are analyzed in a Security Operations Center (SOC).

The goal of this repository is not to showcase advanced coding skills, but to demonstrate an analyst mindset: understanding events, identifying anomalies, and explaining why they matter from a security perspective.
