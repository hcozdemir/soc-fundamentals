# IT Fundamentals – SOC Perspective

## What I learned
- Basic understanding of hardware and software
- How operating systems interact with hardware resources
- Difference between client and server systems
- Basic networking concepts such as IP, LAN, and WAN

## Why this matters for SOC
A SOC analyst must understand IT fundamentals in order to:
- Recognize abnormal system behavior
- Identify where logs are generated
- Understand how systems communicate within a network
- Analyze alerts with proper technical context

## SOC Example
If a system generates repeated authentication failures, an analyst must understand:
- Whether the system is a client or a server
- Which operating system is involved
- Which log sources should be investigated
